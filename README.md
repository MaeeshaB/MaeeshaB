🌱 I’m currently learning
- Software Engineering while working @ [PocketHealth](https://www.pocket.health/en-US/) as a software engineering intern
- Self-teaching the different areas of pastry making: boulanger (baker), confiseur (confectioner), décorateur (decorator), glacier (cold desserts), and using its physical world learnings to become a better designer and product person (also, more self-sufficient).

🤔 I’m looking for help with ... 
- Navigating Artificial Intelligence (Currently Taking an Intro to Deep Learning Course)
- Understanding how to make the highest impact as an individual contributor in life, even more so to work on neglected, underserved, and/or novel problems.
